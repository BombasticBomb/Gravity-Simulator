# Gravity-Simulator
Written In Python, it's a simple gravity simulator that includes a Sun and it's planet orbiting around it. Users are able to manipulate it's orbit by changing the gravity, velocity and can also speed time up and down in the simulation.

Instructions:
For Linux and MacOS users, run the "run.sh" file and make you to mark it executable by running "sudo chmod +x run.sh" in the terminal. For windows users, just run the "gravity.py file". The only dependency is the Ursina Python Library which can be installed by running "pip install ursina".

Controls:
- Use Mouse to look around the simulation, and use WASD with Right click to move around.
- Press "S + Arrow keys" to speed up or slow down the simulation.
- Press "G + Arrow Keys" to increase or decrease the force of gravity.
- Press "I + Arrow Keys" to increase of decrease velocity of the planet.
